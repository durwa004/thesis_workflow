#Plan to try and use snakemake to make this pipeline as user friendly and reusable as possible
#Start with creating a new environment
bash
conda create --name snakemake
source activate snakemake
conda install -c bioconda snakemake

#Look at tutorial for help. This webpage has the basic commands: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html
#
##Run whole pipeline: --forceall
##Dry run: -n
##Get reason for each rule execution: -p
##Run pipeline: snakemake
##Use particular environments: --use-conda
##Run jobs that can be run in parallele in parallele over 4 cores: -j 4
#
##Submit a maximum of 10 jobs at a time: --cluster "qsub -q mcqueue" --jobs 10
##Can also use drmaa: --drmaa " -q name" --jobs 10
##drmaa is the better option (need to look up set up options using GenomeSTRiP)
##Can add a script to determine the job status on the cluster
##May need to check with Rob/Jonah about this
##Can make constraints on the samples that are run
##It is possible to use a job wrapper - may need to look into this.
#
##Visualize the workflow: --dag
